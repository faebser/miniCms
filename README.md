##Introduction
This code is a simple proof-of-concept on how to write inline editable  
html-code withouth a cms, database or like.
##Idea
I really like the back to the basic approach in bulding websites that  
has surfaced recently. So instead of of using a fully fleged cms  
I want to use html5(mainly the contenteditable-attribute), some javascript,  
python with beautiful soup and an external authentication system to  
achieve a way to write inline editable website that are easy to build  
from a developer's side.
##Tech
For the first stage of the proof-of-concept I intend to use the following stuff:
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) module for content transportation
	* Later I want to switch to [create.js](http://createjs.org/)
* [bottle.py](http://bottlepy.org/) for serverside scripting

#License
Until further notice, I release this software under the following licence:

**BEER-and-FOOD**

It's simple. If you like this piece of software and you know me/get to know me/  
meet me you either have to buy me a beer or something (big) to eat.  
If you meet these conditions you are free to use the sourcecode.
